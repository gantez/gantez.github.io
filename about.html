        		Before Gantez there was The Guanoâ€¦ originally founded in 2007 by Levi Prairie, Dylan Sheehan, Nick Hurlbut, and Sean Mueller as an after school creative project to occupy their time whilst experimenting with the conveniently found drugs of the Costa-Mesa newport area. The success of the Guano was basically limited to the open mic nights of the local venue eVocal.
        		After a short go at it they decided to make some changes to the band including changing the name to "Gantez Warrior". The name Gantez was stolen from a family member of Levi. It was a name his older brother and friends called themselves, and wouldn't let Levi be a part of.
			<br><br>
			When the name changed the line up of the band changed as well. it became Levi, Dylan, and a new member Brian Stewart. Brian was the original drummer of the band The Growlers. In 2010 Brian elected to leave the band due to conflicting schedules between Gantez and The Growlers. At this point Ronnie James Dunmore joined the band as the Drummer.
			In 2011 Gantez joined Rick Klotz at Warriors Of Radness records to create the album "Shaka Boogie". due to unfortunate circumstances the album was never officially released but is still findable on the internet.
			in late 2011 Gantez went on a short hiatus of a couple years to expand their brains in the educational form of college. Each member went his own way but eventually reunited in 2013 to write and record the album "Betsy and Gloria Present" with the help of The Hurley family over at Hurley Studios. At the point George Andrew Bender 3rd joined the band to make the three piece a four piece.
			At This Point the band changed their name again by simply dropping the warrior. Officially becoming "Gantez".
			<br><br>
			After recording the album Dylan elected to leave the band and in his place Marrio Barrios joined. Which brings us to Present day Gantez.
			Gantez has a stuidio in Costa Mesa where they have frequent jam parties and play music at local venues. They are now in the process of writing a new album and working on incorporating new sounds to their repertoire.
